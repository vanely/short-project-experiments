Starting a Go project.
  - all Go programs start with in a "main.go" file
  - all Go programs need a "go.mod" file. similar to a "package.json" file in js for listing project dependencies.
  - All Go programs are organized as "packages". All Go code must belong to a "package"
    - this is done through the "package" keyword. "main.go" package name should always be set to "package main"
